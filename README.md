# Interactive World Map of Plastics Hotspots in Oceans and Seas

This project consists of an interactive world map that shows hotspots of plastics detected in the oceans and seas around the world. The map is developed in Python using the Django framework and integrates with technologies such as Leaflet and Heatmap.js for data visualization.

## Data Loading

The project uses CSV files with geographic position information, image, and whether or not it contains plastic to load information. The map loads dynamically and filters can be applied to display only the information of interest.

## Objective

The objective of this project is to contribute to keeping the seas and oceans clean, promoting awareness and respect for marine biodiversity. Through the visualization of hotspots of plastics detected in the oceans and seas around the world, the application aims to raise awareness about the problem of marine pollution and encourage the adoption of sustainable habits to reduce human impact on marine ecosystems.
